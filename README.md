# Interval-Game-with-Scratch

In short, I've made an ear training game for musicians. Every round begins with an audible C-major scale, and then a random interval consisting of any of the 12 notes between C-60 to C-72. Click on the correct keys to play the same notes as the random interval to gain points. You get two chances to fail, upon three fails the game is over.
